# Gaussian-and-Lorentzian-Dirac-Delta-Function-Representations


This repository contains code and plots related to the exploration of different representations of the Dirac delta function using convergence factors. The primary objective is to illustrate the meaning of these representations through examples and derive the well-known integral representation.
